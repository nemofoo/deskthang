# Serial Communication Implementation

## Overview

The serial communication module provides USB CDC (Communications Device Class) functionality for reliable data transfer between the host and device. The implementation uses the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK's stdio/USB functionality (`pico/stdlib.h` and `pico/stdio.h`), while respecting the packet protocol requirements.

## Key Features

- Protocol-aware buffering and transfers
- Timeout-based operations (using BASE_TIMEOUT_MS)
- Automatic flush management
- Error logging and recovery
- Clean initialization/deinitialization

## Buffer Management

All buffer sizes are defined in protocol.h:
- Maximum packet size: `MAX_PACKET_SIZE` (512 bytes)
- Chunk size: `CHUNK_SIZE` (256 bytes)
- Uses Pico's stdio buffering for USB communication
- Automatic flush after each chunk write

## Core Functions

### Initialization

```c
bool serial_init(void);
```
- Initializes Pico stdio for USB (`stdio_init_all()`)
- Sets up error handling and logging
- Returns true when ready for communication

### Read Operations

```c
bool serial_read(uint8_t *data, size_t len);
```
- Non-blocking read using `getchar_timeout_us`
- Returns true if exact number of bytes read
- Implements timeout-based operation (BASE_TIMEOUT_MS)
- Reports underflow conditions through error logging

### Write Operations

```c
bool serial_write(const uint8_t *data, size_t len);
bool serial_write_chunk(const uint8_t *data, size_t len);
```
- `write`: Handles large writes with automatic chunking
- `write_chunk`: Writes a single chunk using `fwrite` to stdout
- Both implement error logging for overflow and timeout conditions
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Buffer Control

```c
void serial_flush(void);
bool serial_available(void);
void serial_clear(void);
```
- `flush`: Forces immediate transmission of buffered data
- `available`: Checks for pending received data
- `clear`: Discards any unread received data

## Error Handling

The serial interface integrates with the system's error logging:
- Overflow detection and reporting
- Timeout monitoring
- Retry management with backoff
- Basic overflow statistics tracking:
  - Overflow count
  - Last overflow timestamp
  - Current overflow state

## Usage Guidelines

1. Initialize serial communication at system startup
2. Monitor error conditions through logging
3. Handle overflow conditions appropriately
4. Implement retry logic for critical operations
5. Clear buffers when changing protocol states

## Integration Points

- Error System: Reports through `logging_error_details`
- State Machine: Supports protocol state transitions
- Hardware Layer: Part of hardware abstraction
- Debug System: Tracks basic overflow metrics

## Implementation Notes

1. Non-blocking operations with timeout protection
2. Automatic overflow detection and recovery
3. Static buffer allocation with size validation
4. Basic overflow tracking
5. Proper USB connection handling

## Error Recovery

- Implements exponential backoff for retries
- Tracks overflow conditions and recovery
- Provides detailed error context for debugging
- Supports automatic recovery for transient errors
